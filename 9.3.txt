fumeng: it is for collecting and moving large amount of data into hdfs
	yarn coordinates data ingest from apache flume and other services that deliver raw
        data into an hadoop cluster
	flume requires some core classes and systems to solve issues and limitations
 	it has simple and flexible architecture based streaming data flow
======================================================================================================
2)Can Flume provides 100 % reliability to the data flow?
   
   
  	yes,it provide 100% reliability of data flow 
	since it provide end to end reliablity,sources and sinks encapsulated in a 
 	transactional repository provides by the channel
===============================================================================================
3)
   Can Flume can distributes data to multiple destinations?



	yes,flume can distributes data to multiple destinations sice itsupport multiplexing flow
	the event flow from one source to multiple channels and acheived by flow multiplexer

======================================================================================================

4)
Explain about the different channel types in Flume. And which channel type is
faster?

The two channel types in flume are
MEMORY Channel :Events are read from the source into memory and passed to the sink.

FILE Channel :File Channel writes the contents to a file on the file system after reading 
the event from a source. 
The file is deleted only  after the contents are successfully delivered to the sink.

MEMORY Channel :sis the fastest channel among the three however has the risk of data loss. 
The channel that you choose completely depends on the nature of the big data application 
and the value of each event.
